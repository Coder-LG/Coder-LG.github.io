So, I made a lot of projects in 2020.
My first project was a calculator app. Then, I forked a diary app from GitHub and did a lot of updates. Then, I made a snake game, thanks to TokyoEdTech, he showed up and I made it finally.
Just scroll down and click the GitHub icon, and you can see my projects. NO FORKING ALLOWED!
